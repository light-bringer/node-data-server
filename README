Assignment : 
Do this ideally in node or a python framework;

- Setup a database on the cloud (preferably mysql) - It can contain any data, any number of columns you desire. 
- Create a set of API's to basically insert new records into the DB, modify existing records as well as delete records
- Your benchmark for this exercise should be this - The ability for the above API to do 1000 selects/updates per second on the database

Extra Credit: 
1. You can get creative and create multiple tables for your API's to respond to, print some stats like records fetched, time take to fetch, put some validations in place and also have good logging. Also, would love to see unit test cases
2. If you can build a simple web front-end to display your api activity, that will be a bonus!

Essentially I will look at these things post your assignment submission;
1. Knowledge of DBâ€™s
2. Knowledge of language
3. Knowledge of rest services
4. ability to use git or some other code version tool
5. setup the environment on some cloud infra (aws/gcp/azure)
